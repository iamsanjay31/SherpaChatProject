            <h2>What is a test?</h2>
<p>With a test you can test the knowledge level of the students. Mostly this is done with a series of questions. The questions can differ in form or format, but in the end you want your students to asnwer questions so you can grade&nbsp;them and see what result they get.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good teacher adjusts it's course material according the results of the tests he gives. So he can improve. The results can point the educator to part of his course material which aren't clear. Or where it's class needs some extra attention so it will pass the final exam.</p>

         <h2><strong>User-friendly system</strong></h2>
<p>User-friendly systems are not only needed for the creator, but also for participants. &ldquo;Intuitive&rdquo; is key. One of the best examples is the software of the iPhone. It has a lot of options, but is still something you can figure out without needing a manual. Of course,&nbsp;an online examination system is different, but still has some similarities. Once an online examination system is not user-friendly, creators and participants will move on to another system. This is obviously something you don't want to happen.</p>
<h2><strong>Responsive design</strong></h2>
<p>A responsive design is an approach where the web designer wants to reach an optimal web experience for a wide range of devices. A responsive site scales with the size of the screen without sacrificing the text readability or usability of the user interface.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Offering several types of questions</strong></h2>
<p>Multiple choice, fill in the blanks and free text. These are the options you can use with our online examination system. Having more than one options is necessary to check several types of knowledge. Not all examination can be checked with multiple choice questions. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Auto exam publish</strong></h2>
<p>Do you want your exam for anyone or for a predefined group of users? The online exam can be made for people who are invited to the exam and have to log in with a username and password. If your exam is free for anyone, you can insert a link for making the exam.</p>
<h2><strong>Automatically checked answers</strong></h2>
<p>Having to check all answers is very time-consuming. So, having the answers checked automatically and instantly will eventually pay off. It&rsquo;s less work for the creator of the exam and participants don&rsquo;t have to wait too long for getting the results of their exams. Catching two birds with one stone :)</p>
<h2><strong>Group report performance analysis</strong></h2>
<p>Having the results and statistics is nice to get a whole overview of the performances. Which&nbsp;users score best? On what kind of questions did users score low at? It&rsquo;s all possible with our tool. And know what&rsquo;s even better? Administrators can export the results and statistics to an Excel file.</p>
